mul_str= '''
Artists producing banknotes in Colonial America began experimenting with copper 
plates as an alternative to wood engraving in the early 18th century.
Applied to the production of paper currency, copper-plate engraving, 
and later steel engraving, enabled banknote design and printing to rapidly advance during the 19th century.
This engraved vignette appeared on certain United States five-dollar bills issued in 1875.
Produced for the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the engraving is of John Vanderlyn's 
painting Landing of Columbus, which hangs in the United States Capitol rotunda.
It depicts Christopher Columbus landing on San Salvador Island on October 12, 1492, on the first of his voyages to the New World.
